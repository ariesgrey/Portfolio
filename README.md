# Thinkful Portfolio Webpage
My very first portfolio website, and very first original GitHub repo.

A single page site with:
- 'Intro', 'About Me', and 'Contact' sections
- header, footer, article, and div containers
- ordered and unordered lists
- absolute, relative, and contact links
- basic css styling of background, text, and containers, including classes
- link styling using pseudo-classes

Thanks for checking it out!
