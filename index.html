        <p>Hey there! My name is Aries, I'm 24 years old, and I live in the western suburbs of Chicago.</p>
        <p>Let's play a little game of 2 Truths and a Lie about me:</p>
        <ol> <!-- Ordered List -->
          <li>I have lived in the Chicago area my whole life</li>
          <li>I am unable to visualize things in my head</li>
          <li>I love to play video games</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can find the answer at the very bottom of the page (<a href="#answer">here</a>).</p>
        <p>Thank you for checking out my site!</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Problem solving is something that has always tickled my brain. I always loved algebra as a kid, it felt like a game to me. In high school, I found out that a lot of coding felt the same way, especially writing functions.</p>
      <p>Had I gone through college, I most likely would have come out with a degree in Computer Science, but college just wasn't in the cards for me. I tried out cosmetology school, but about halfway through the program I experienced the onset of my Ankylosing Spondylitis symptoms, which made standing on my feet doing hair all day every day no longer possible. </p>
      <p>I've been working part-time as a salon receptionist ever since, just trying to make ends meet and with no idea of what direction I wanted to go with my life. Until the day one of my coworkers mentioned doing a coding bootcamp, and when I researched and found some that offered part-time courses and deferred tuition, I realized that coding could still be an option for me.</p>
      <p> I'm very excited to be jumping back into it, and gaining the opportunity to work in the field. I would love to be able to code for a living, and I definitely believe that I'm on my way to being very good at it. I am also looking forward to meeting and working with other coders, and continuing to learn through others after this course.</p>
      <p>Outside of coding, you can usually find me watching one of my favorite twitch streamers or youtubers, listening to alternative music, or spending time with my fiance Logan and our little earless cat Topsy.</p>
